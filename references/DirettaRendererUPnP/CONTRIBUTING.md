## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Install dependencies (Fedora example)
sudo dnf install git gcc-c++ make ffmpeg-devel libupnp-devel

# Download Diretta SDK from https://www.diretta.link/hostsdk.html
# Extract to ~/DirettaHostSDK_147/
```

### Fork and Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SwissMontainsBear/DirettaRendererUPnP-X.git
cd DirettaRendererUPnP-X

git remote add upstream https://github.com/SwissMontainsBear/DirettaRendererUPnP-X.git
```

### Build and Test

```bash
make clean
make

# Test manually
sudo ./bin/DirettaRendererUPnP --target 1 --port 4005
```

### Keep Your Fork Updated

```bash
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main
```

## Coding Standards

### C++ Style (C++17)

#### Naming Conventions

```cpp
class AudioEngine { };           // Classes: PascalCase
void processAudio();             // Functions: camelCase
std::string m_currentURI;        // Members: m_ prefix
const int MAX_BUFFER_SIZE;       // Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
namespace diretta { }            // Namespaces: lowercase
```

#### Formatting

- **Indentation**: 4 spaces (no tabs)
- **Braces**: Opening brace on same line
- **Line length**: Max 120 characters

#### Best Practices

```cpp
// Use smart pointers
std::unique_ptr<AudioEngine> m_audioEngine;

// Use const where possible
void process(const AudioBuffer& buffer);

// Use named constants
const uint32_t CD_SAMPLE_RATE = 44100;
```

### Logging Format

```cpp
std::cout << "[ComponentName] Message" << std::endl;
std::cerr << "[ComponentName] Error: " << details << std::endl;
```
